# 1. Comparing Yourself to the Beginning of the Year

What skills did you not have then, but have now?
At the beginning of the year, I barely knew how to use most of the tools in computer science. I didn’t really understand VS Code, GitHub, or how websites were structured. Now, after one semester of AP CSP, I have more understanding of writing code in both JavaScript and Python, I am able to build pages on my website, and organize my files correctly.

How has your confidence changed?
My confidence has grown a lot because debugging no longer feels impossible. 

Are you better at debugging, organizing files, understanding syntax, managing time, or collaborating?
I’m better at using AI to help myself, finding errors, checking the console, and fixing mistakes. I’m also more organized with my repositories and better at managing my time during long assignments. Collaborating with others has become easier too.

# 2. Key Takeaways From the Three Sprints

Choose the 3 that apply (Tools, Fundamentals of JS/Python, West Coast Travel, Digital Famine, etc.):

## Sprint 1: Tools

This sprint helped me understand the basics: VS Code, GitHub, the Terminal, and Jekyll.
At first, GitHub was confusing because I didn’t understand how commits and pushes worked, but now it makes sense. Learning how the Terminal controls environments and how Jekyll builds my website made me feel like a real developer.

## Sprint 2: Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python

I learned loops, conditionals, variables, functions, and how programs process data.
I feel a little more comfortable with Python because the syntax is cleaner, but I’m improving in JavaScript too.
One assignment I’m proud of was the game hacks, it was the first assignment I did by myself, but I figured it out.

## Sprint 3: Digital Famine

In this sprint, I worked with knowledges and used it to build my team's project. I learned what an AI API is and how to use it.
The part of my project that worked best was organizing the words of knowledges and showing it in a way that made sense. Even when code doesn't work, I learned to fix them piece by piece.

# 3. N@tM (Night at the Museum) Reflection

N@tM was exciting because I got to share my project with real visitors.
People were curious about my project, and a few even said they liked the design and the idea behind it.
One thing that surprised me was how explaining something out loud made me notice small improvements I could make.
Next time, I’d prepare a shorter explanation and add more visuals and funny factors in my contexts so people will understand the project faster in a fun way.

# 4. Project Next Steps

If I had more time, I would:

- Add more features to make the project interactive

- Improve the UI to look cleaner and more professional

- Use better data or add graphs

- Add animations to make it more fun

- Organize the code so it’s easier to update later

# 5. What You Want to Learn Next in CompSci

Next semester, I want to learn:

- More JavaScript—especially functions, DOM manipulation, and animations

- React or Next.js so I can build real web apps

- Data visualization to make projects look more professional

- Algorithms so I can improve my problem-solving skills

# 7. MCQ Review
### 39/66

corrections:

Q1. The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of second, which has been stored in first, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the value of second has not changed from its initial value.

Q7. The code segment initially sets start to 1, end to 20, and current to 3. Next, the code segment sets start to the value of current, which is 3. Then current is increased from 3 to 4. The final values of start and current are 3 and 4, respectively.

Q9. Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.

Q12. The total number of registered users appears to be increasing by about 0.5 million each year, so in year 12, the number of users can be approximated at 31.2 million (30.2 + 0.5 + 0.5).

Q13. The average number of characters per message appears to decrease after the mobile app was released.

Q14.  The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

Q22. This Boolean expression evaluates to true when counter (the number of temperatures greater than or equal to 90) is greater than 50% of total (the number of entries in the list).

Q23. Redundant routing is impossible if there is only one possible path from one device to another. There is only one possible path from P to S (P to R to Q to S).

Q28. Using 8 bits will allow for up to 256 characters open parenthesis, 2 raised to the eighth power equals 256, close parenthesis.

Q30. Each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. The procedure is called
once before the loop, and then four times inside the loop (once for each of the four entries in One word, genre List). Therefore, the program will take approximately 5 hours to execute.

Q33. The flowchart sets include to true whenever floor is greater than 1 0 or bedrooms equal 3, and sets include to false otherwise. Therefore, the algorithm is equivalent to     Include, left arrow, open parenthesis, floor greater than 10, close parenthesis, OR, open parenthesis, bedrooms equal 3, close parenthesis.

Q38. The expression count, MOD, 10 equals 0 evaluates to true when count is a multiple of 1 0, and so this
code segment sets cost to 0 under the appropriate conditions.

Q40. The average total points earned per student can be determined using the result of the total points calculation
for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by
calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. The proportion of students
who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by comparing the midterm and final scores for each student with the result of the total points calculation.

Q43. The pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. 

Q44. With a 4-bit integer representation, 2 to the fourth power values can be represented, which allows for the values between 0 to 1 5, inclusive. If an operation results in a value greater than 1 5, an overflow error will occur. Of the operations given in the options, only 10 plus 7 gives a result larger than 1 5.

Q45. The expression P AND Q evaluates to true when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to false otherwise. Therefore, the expression NOT, open parenthesis, P AND Q, close parenthesis evaluates to false when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to true otherwise.

Q46. An undecidable problem is one in which no algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer.

Q50. The procedure implements a linear search, which sequentially compares each element of the list with the target value. The list does not need to be sorted because the procedure checks list elements until either the target is found or it reaches the end of the list.

Q53. Machine learning is the process of a computer analyzing data in order to make predictions and decisions based on trends in the data.

Q54. The procedures square and cube are each used to determine a power of n. A generalization of this procedure
is Power, open parenthesis, n comma m, close parenthesis, which calculates n raised to the mpower.

Q55. The expression open parenthesis, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, y, close quotation, close parenthesis, AND, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, yes, close quotation, close parenthesis, close parenthesisalways evaluates to false because it is not possible for the variable response to be equal to both Open quotation, y, close quotation and Open quotation, yes, close quotation. Therefore, the procedure will always
return false.

Q56. The value of count starts at 1 and increases by twos, so it counts odd integers. The loop iterates 10
times, adding each intermediate value of count each time. Therefore, the program displays the sum of the odd integers starting at 1 and ending at 19.

Q58. The Internet can provide tools, information, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants and can lower geographic barriers to potential participants. However, there exist problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time, even with a distributed approach.

Q60. Creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.

Q62. As any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to contribute.

Q64. Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data.

Q65. If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases.

# 8. Something Cool You’d Like to Share

One cool thing this semester was finally fixing a bug that kept breaking my JavaScript page. It turned out to be the Java symbol we use to run Javascript in the python enviroment. After finding it, the whole program worked perfectly.

I also discovered shortcuts in VS Code, like selecting multiple lines at once, which made editing much faster.
Overall, even though this semester was challenging, it was fun seeing myself improve.
